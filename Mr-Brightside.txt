<h1>Why love doesn't allow people to do something with their lives</h1>
<hr />
<i>Probably</i> one of the most perceptual needs of the humanity is the one to be loved</br>
in their lives; roughly, not anybody can have that possibility, even if they are "special ones".</br>
</p>
<p>The modern world is a constant and strong <strong>suffering</strong> in a matter of facts, and you can see it everywhere</br>
(depending on what kind of place do you live).<i>The pleasure comes weirdly</i>, and in unseen forms,</br>
as the subtitles of the japanese movies; that show in the most anticlimatic scenes the words, just to spell</br>
the dialogue of the past scene.<p/>
<P>If anyone of you, <i>fuckers</i>, previously listen to a "Love" song, you can tell what a frustrating feeling</br>
is like.</br>
I mean, most people think that love is a primal feature of the life, but... ¿Guess what?<strong> Is not</strong>.</br>
Love, in a especial place of the life, is <i>the most horrible experience</i>; it makes you feel dull, pointless</br>
in the moment of life you continue after feeling it, with low steem or steemless, and <strong>stupid</strong>.</br>
Yeah, love is stupid, as are the people.</br>
¿Why a "Love song"? Well, you start there, hanging out with friends or going to a mall with your parents, and</br>
suddenly in a ramdom place, there is the fucking love of your life. She <del>or he</del> has pretty eyes, a lovely smile</br>
, 100% christian outfits, a specific but natural tone of hair, also beautiful, a pale perfect skin and the motherfucking</br>
voice of an angel.</br> 
Your heart feels like if it start beating again.</br>
But is not the kind of person <strong>YOU</strong> think you can reach.</br>
Shit, what a horrible feeling has to be, when you meet someone, or just watch , but is so perfect that you feel drugged</br>
and stupid. Also in that scenary, you choose to talk whith she <del>or he</del> and fuck up all telling your boring jokes</br> 
and falling in love with his faked laughs.</br>
<p>The time passes and eventually, you call her for hanging out, eat and laugh together.</br>
The life begins to be something really interesting, and you like the place you are right now, you can tell others what</br>
happiness is like. You and her tell histories of the childhood, your best and worst memories, giving some support every</br>
time you two are depressed for the nostalgia, or even if it's not that, both of you can keep the other in calm.</br>
The times gies by, and you don't notice, it's too good to be true, but it seems to be.</br>
You call her once to go to the cinema, you buy her some cornpops and candies, you choose a great movie to see</br>
and you two enter and sit, handholding.</br>
The movie is simply great and you're enjoying it at full. She looks at you sometimes to smile and touch your hand in the</br>
sit, or to hug you when a sudden scene shows up.</p>

<p><strong>You think she can turn into your wife someday.</strong>

<p> You finally end in a bed with <strong>love songs</strong> in the background,</br>
cuddling and kissing each other, filling that empty place that had been like that for a long while in your bed.</br>
But, in the last kiss before start sex, she stops and says:</br>
<strong>-Hey, did you just hang out with me to have sex?</strong></br>
And you think <i>"Fuck, did she lived that before me?"</i> or <i>"Well, not, but now we're here..."</i> believing nothing could be</br>
worst than fuck all with the single girl you just meet. So you stop, trying not to be violent or overreactive with that</br>
question and say to her:</br>
<strong>-No, i don't. I think you're beautiful, funny, intelligent and sweet, maybe i love you <em>(you love her)</em> and i just</br>
want to spend time with you like nothing matters, trying to complete each other in the most powerful way, i really don't</br>
care if we are on a relationship or not. I just want to cuddle and feel the warm of your body in my body.</strong></br>
And she responds:</br>
-Awww, that´s sweet but, i already have someone.</br>
What? What's that bullshit she says? Man, that really hurts.</br>
You just stare at her face, waiting for a laugh, that she doesn't gives to you, and the dissapointment start to flow.</br>
The song ends and your heart is a bit broken, maybe you say weren't looking for a relationship but, she doesn't cares and</br>
humiliates you in that private defenseless scenario you are.</br>    
You only remember the song ending.</br>
<strong>"Love is fucking stupid..."</strong></p>
